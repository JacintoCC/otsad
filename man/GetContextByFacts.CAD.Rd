\title{Get Context By Facts for Contextual Anomaly Detector}
\usage{
GetContextByFacts.CAD(context.list, context.operator, zero.level = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{context.list}{List of potentially new contexts}

\item{context.operator}{Environment with the current status for the
context operator.}

\item{zero.level}{Flag indicating the context type in transmitted
list}
}
\value{
Depending on the type of  potentially new context transmitted as
an input parameters the function returns either:
  Ð°) flag indicating that the transmitted zero-level context is
a new/existing one;
or:
  b) number of the really new contexts that have been saved to the
context memory.
}
\description{
\code{GetContextByFacts.CAD} is an auxiliary method that determine
by the complete facts list whether the context is already saved to
the memory. If the context is not found the function immediately
creates such. To optimize speed and volume of the occupied memory
the contexts are divided into semi-contexts as several contexts can
contain the same facts set in its left and right parts.
